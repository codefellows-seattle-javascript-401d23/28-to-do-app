## Overview

This app lets the user create notes. It has a lading page and dashboard where the user can add the new notes with title and content and remove each of them with a click.

## Getting Started

1. To start you need to install all the necessary dependencies and create all the directories.
2. Start with building webpack.common.js and webpack.dev.js files.
3. Create  necessary components for: dashboard, lading page, note form, note item, note list and app.
4. Link them so the App was a parent of dashboard and landing page. Dashboard is a parent of note form and note list and note list is a parent of note item.
5. Render all the components into HTML.
6. Change scss file accordingly.
