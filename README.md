Lab 28: To-Do App
===

**Author:** Jennifer Piper

This is a super-simple task-list app to demonstrate using React.

## Getting Started
In a node.js environment, from the root of this repo, install dependencies:
* `npm i`


To start the app at `http://localhost:8080/`:
* ` npm run watch`

At `http://localhost:8080/` the landing page will show with a very brief introduction. 
Click on the Dashboard link to navigate to the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard`.
This will show a form to create new notes with a title(optional) and text content(required).

Notes are displayed in a list as they are created, with a Delete button for each individual note. Click the Delete button to remove that note from the list.
