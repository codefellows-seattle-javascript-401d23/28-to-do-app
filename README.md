# To Do List App
**Author**: Sarah
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)
## Overview
This is a very basic to-do list single page application using the React library
## Getting Started
- fork this repo
- npm i to install dependencies
- npm run watch to open a tab in your default browser which runs the app
## Architecture
babel is used for transpiling, webpack is bundling, sass is adding funcitonality to the css, react is providing the library to manage state, components etc in a SPA, react-router-dom is making the pseudo-routes and history, mini-css-loader is bundling our css into a single linked css file, eslint is keeping the code consistent... uuid is making some great unique ids.
