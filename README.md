# Overview
This application creates a To-Do list utilizing the React library.

# Architecture
The main point of entry of this application is the main.js file which transpiles the app by utilizing the babel library. This application also utilizes multiple NPM libraries and .travis.yml for its CI. The 'component' directory contains all the various React components that app.js consists of.

# Testing
To test the initial state of the Dashboard and NoteForm components, enter the following in the CLI:

`npm run test`
# Change Log
