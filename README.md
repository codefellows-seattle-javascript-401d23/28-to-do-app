# LAB 28 Routing and Testing

## Objectives: 
The objectives of this lab are to refactor the previously created modular application that introduced routing in the react sense of the word for a single page application. This involves introducing new modal and modularization. Also integrating front end testing, and passing the props through multiple levels aka grandchild inheiritance. 

## Tools: 
React, enzyme(testing), jest(testing), Webpack and babel packages. 

Contributors to my success in this lab were: Seth and Dan.
