## Lab 29 - To-Do App

I am using React to build an application that will allow users to create 'to-do' items so they can stay on top of their daily tasks

To use:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Run `npm i`
- Type `npm run watch` into the console to generate page in browser
- Landing page will show a brief description of what the app does
- Navigate to dashboard to enter new to-do items onto list, title is required for new notes
- When finished, click on `finished?` button on item to clear it from list
